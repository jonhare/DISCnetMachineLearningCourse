# DISCnet Machine Learning Course

## Old Thorns, Hiplook 30th June-4th July 2025

Notes, demos and materials for learning Machine Learning

## Extra materials

In addition to the material in this git repository, I've also used materials from my computer vision, data mining and deep learning modules. Please feel free to take a look at the lecture slides and notes for these which can be found here:

## Extra Activities
<!-- Cumberland lodge is a beautiful building set in the centre of Windsor Great Park. -->
Weather permitting Jon, Niranjan and Adam are likely to go for a walk (possibly to a pub on occasion). If you would like to join us (or go for and independent walk) please take comfortable shoes.
